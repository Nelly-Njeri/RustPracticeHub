## Rust Calculator Implementations

This folder contains different implementations of a simple calculator in Rust, demonstrating various approaches to handling arithmetic operations.

## Implementations

## 1. Simple Functions(implementation1.rs)
This implementation uses separate functions for each arithmetic operation.

## 2. Single Function with Operator Parameter(implementation2.rs)
This implementation uses a single function with an operator parameter to handle different arithmetic operations.

## 3. Enum-Based Calculator(implementation3.rs)
This implementation uses an enum to represent different operations, providing a more structured approach.
